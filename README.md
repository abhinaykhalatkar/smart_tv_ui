## Assignment 1

In this assignment, we focused on creating the initial design and user experience for the smart TV interface. The following components were developed:

- Persona: Detailed user profiles that represent our target audience.
- User Stories: Descriptions of various scenarios and interactions from the user's perspective.
- User Flow: Visualization of the user's journey and interactions within the TV interface.
- Lo-fi Prototype: Low-fidelity prototype showcasing the basic layout and functionality of the interface.
- Hi-fi Prototype: High-fidelity prototype, including visual design and interactive elements. A PDF version of the hi-fi prototype is available in the repository. You can also access the prototype on Figma using the provided link.

## Assignment 2

In this assignment, we focused on implementing the TV UI designs using HTML and CSS. The goal was to translate the hi-fi prototype into a functional user interface. The repository contains the necessary HTML and CSS files for the TV UI design.

Additionally, we have included a research report in PDF format, which provides insights and analysis related to our design decisions and user testing results.

## Assignment 3

In this assignment, we leveraged React to develop the TV UI. To set up the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Install the project dependencies by running the command:
npm install

2. Start the development server by running the command:
